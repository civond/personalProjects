<h2>Image Processing</h2>
<br/>Raw imaging data can contain various types of noise (Gaussian, salt and pepper, etc.). If your goal is to extract data from such images, being able to minimize noise can greatly improve the accuracy of the data produced. In this example, I used Python OpenCV to "restore" the image quality of a noisy grayscale image using mathematical filters.

<h2>Usage</h2>
Replace 'camasLily.jpg' with whichever image name you wish to use.
